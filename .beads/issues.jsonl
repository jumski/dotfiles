{"id":"dotfiles-kqu","title":"Hive: arbitrary paths + window naming prompt","description":"## Problem\nHive only opens muxit worktrees by default and window naming silently auto-suffixes without user input, which can lead to confusing behavior when names collide (e.g., dotfiles -\u003e dotfiles-2 -\u003e dotfiles-3 should be created reliably).\n\n## Goals\n- Allow arbitrary directories across all Hive commands (spawn/session/window/split) via `--path` and interactive selection.\n- Always prompt for a window name when creating a new window in the spawn wizard, with a preselected default you can accept by pressing Enter.\n- Provide explicit `--session-name` and `--window-name` flags for consistent overrides across commands.\n- Fix window name collisions so they always create a new unique name instead of silently skipping.\n\n## UX / Flow\n### Path selection (new picker)\n- Replace/extend `_hive_pick_worktree` with `_hive_pick_path`.\n- Options shown in order, with the first option preselected:\n  1. `Current directory` (uses `pwd`)\n  2. `Custom path` (prompt for arbitrary directory)\n  3. Muxit worktrees from `~/.cache/muxit-projects` resolved via `_hive_resolve_path`\n- Selected path must exist; resolve via `realpath`. Cancel returns empty.\n\n### Spawn wizard\n- Step 1: Path selection uses `_hive_pick_path` (unless `--path` provided).\n- Step 2: Destination selection (new session vs existing hive session) unchanged.\n- Step 3: Window selection for existing session:\n  - If `--window-name` provided: skip step 3 and always create a new window with that name.\n  - Otherwise, show \"[+] New Window\" vs existing windows. If \"New Window\" chosen, prompt for name.\n- `--session-name` in spawn:\n  - If it matches an existing hive session, use it as the destination session.\n  - If it does not exist, create a new hive session with that name.\n\n### Window naming prompt\n- New helper `_hive_next_window_name \u003csession\u003e \u003cbase\u003e` returns the first available name: `name`, `name-2`, `name-3`, etc.\n- New helper `_hive_prompt_window_name \u003csession\u003e \u003cbase\u003e`:\n  - Compute `suggested` via `_hive_next_window_name`.\n  - Use fzf to choose between:\n    - the suggested name (preselected)\n    - `Custom name`\n  - If \"Custom name\" chosen, prompt for input; empty input falls back to `suggested`.\n  - If custom name collides, auto-suffix via `_hive_next_window_name` (no re-prompt).\n\n## Flags\n- Add `--path` to `hive spawn`, `hive session`, `hive window`, `hive split`.\n- Add `--session-name` and `--window-name` to `hive spawn`, `hive session`, `hive window`.\n- Preserve positional path compatibility for all commands.\n- Use `argparse` for consistent parsing.\n\n## Command behavior\n- `hive session`:\n  - Uses `--session-name` override for session creation.\n  - Uses `--window-name` override for the first window (auto-suffix if collision is somehow possible).\n  - Errors if session already exists (unchanged).\n- `hive window`:\n  - Accepts `--session-name` (default: current session).\n  - Prompts for window name if `--window-name` is not provided.\n  - Auto-suffixes name on collisions (no silent failure).\n- `hive split`:\n  - Accepts `--path` for arbitrary directories.\n  - Still requires running inside a hive tmux session.\n\n## Help updates\n- Update `hive/functions/hive.fish` and per-command `--help` to document new flags and picker behavior.\n\n## Files to change\n- `hive/lib/common.fish`\n- `hive/functions/hive_spawn.fish`\n- `hive/functions/hive_window.fish`\n- `hive/functions/hive_session.fish`\n- `hive/functions/hive_split.fish`\n- `hive/functions/hive.fish`\n- `hive/tests/common.test.fish`\n\n## Tests\n- Add tests for `_hive_next_window_name` in `hive/tests/common.test.fish`:\n  - no conflicts -\u003e base name\n  - single conflict -\u003e `name-2`\n  - multiple conflicts -\u003e `name-3`, `name-4`, etc.\n- Run `script/test wt` (or `script/test`) before finalizing.\n","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2026-01-15T12:36:51.608694403+01:00","updated_at":"2026-01-15T14:49:00.39242471+01:00","closed_at":"2026-01-15T14:49:00.39242471+01:00","close_reason":"Closed","created_by":"jumski"}
