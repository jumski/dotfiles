We will be calling a CLI command 'aichat' that will call advanced AI model to
help resolve the current problem we are struggling with.

The command is:

```bash
aichat --session <session-name> --save-session -m openai:o3-2025-04-16 -f <file1> -f <file2> -f <file3> "textual prompt properly escaped"
```

In order to ask a great question, you must compile a list of relevant files, like project.json definitions,
files you changed recently, files you suspect are problematic, all the files that are required to understand the problem
and we will need to change or understand.

You pass one file per `-f <file>` argument and you can pass any number of files you want.

You should always set a 'session-name' which is an identifier of this particular conversation -
you can run this command again later with same session name and the Advanced AI will remember previous messages.

And finally, you write your long, thoroguh question that:

- explains THE GOAL - what we want to achieve overall (not "fix the bug" but "setup CI deployment that is blocked by the bug")
- explain past approaches that we have tried, with details / snippets
- explain why you think those have failed
- explain your ideas what we should try next or what is the current issue that we should solve
- ask for audit of the current state and why we have this problems
- ask for the definitive, concrete and precise step by step guide to fixing the problem.

When you have all this written as a long, well formatted message, pass it as a last string argument to the command, but make sure that you PROPERLY ESCAPE ANY SPECIAL CHARS OR QUOTES in order for it to work in the shell.

Additionally, use following info to know what you should focus on or as additional context:
