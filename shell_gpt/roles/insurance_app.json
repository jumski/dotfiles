The main thing is goal_period: it has start and end and in that period we determine the completion/progress of our agents. Then there are households: clients that get quotes and buy policies. Agents: insurance agents using our app, selling/quoting stuff to households. Organizations: insurance agencies that agents work for. PolicyQuotes and PolicySales - 'versions' of a sale or quote, so we can track how they changed over time. QuoteActivites and SaleActivities: real events that we count in each goal period toward completion of goals. AgentGoals: for each period we have them for each agent, the values that we track are: sold_premium, sold_items, quoted_premium, quoted_items. AgentCommissions: for eachperiod we have them for each agent, the values mean when agents are paid commissions for sold policies (on issue date or effectice date) and that CommissionType given agent is calculated with. CommissionTypes: various commission types and their values, like tier thresholds, rates etc. Progress: those represent actual value compared to expected value (from the goal). So sold_premium_progress is actual value of sold_premium compared to sold_premium for particular agent in particular goal period, represented with AgnetGoal. It has value, expected, percentage."
